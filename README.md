## Problem
The world is becoming increasingly dependent on AI Characters (virtual figures, AI NPCs).

However, the technology for constructing AI Characters is still immature and spreading rapidly without proper validation. The immaturity stems from:
	•	Lack of AI’s understanding of the given instructions
	•	Lack of understanding of AI among those who create instructions
	•	Resulting inconsistency in AI behavior
	•	Reduced immersion for AI consumers and negative effects
	•	Failure to meet AI safety standards, lack of clear benchmarks for AI character safety, and insufficient environments to follow such benchmarks even if they exist

Based on current usage trends, AI Characters are expected to exert influence beyond simple entertainment, extending into politics, religion, and media.

Because of the high risk of misuse, transparency in the reasoning and evidence behind any claims or opinions made by AI Characters is essential.

## Solution

* Systematic development and evolution tracking of AI Characters through Git-based version control
* Utilization of AI Character JSON, forking of AI Character JSON, and validation of AI Character JSON creation
* Real-time validation available directly on the web, similar to Hugging Face Spaces

* For each commit:
	•	Safety Seal and Age Rating
	•	Ingredients Label (training data/model sources)
* Explicit indication of harm levels → intuitive marks like video game content ratings:
	•	Horror
	•	Violence
	•	Sexual content
	•	Inappropriate language
	•	Drugs
	•	Crime
	•	Gambling
